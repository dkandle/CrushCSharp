The project these tools were developed for involved collecting data to determine airport usage and identify safety issues at my local airport.
Based on the software for that project I’ve produced a simple Windows program which will take an audio file as input and output a condensed audio file which has the dead time removed and the time codes inserted.
NOTE: In this version the time inserted will be the time that the file was processed. It has no way to know the time that the original recording was made. In a “real” version of this tool, you would be able to enter a date-time of the original recording.
